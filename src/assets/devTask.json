Matt is on board the Trek Domane of Yaroslav Popovych that was used in the spring classics of the 2016 season.\n\nThe monocoque frame design of the Trek Domane features an IsoSpeed decoupler to aid comfort as well as doubling vertical compliance. A handy feature for the cobbled races is the integrated chainkeeper/catcher should the rough stuff throw your chain off! \n\nThe Colnago C40 was and still is highly commended for it's comfort and also the stiffness due to the pro's edition receiving extra layers of carbon. Check out Simon's stretched out position, a true belgian classic hardman position, long and low!\n\nThe terrain that the guys rode the bikes in was the Flemish Ardennes ideal for bikes of this nature!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?v=aubcNAX45NM\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nRetro Bike Or Modern Bike?

Once you become confident it is second nature.\n\nTop tips include\n- Look where you are going\n- Lean the bike over into the corner\n- Drop your outside pedal; have your outside pedal in the 6 o'clock position and apply a little weight to it\n\nWhen cornering in a group, communication is key - signalling tight turns is helpful and offers a warning that the riders around you are slowing down. When braking, it's typically best to apply pressure to both the front and rear brake evenly, ideally before you enter the corner. Leaning your bike into the turn and keeping your body low will increase the available traction in the turn itself.\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nDescending Made Easy üìπ  http://gcn.eu/7j\nHow To Ride In Rain And Wet Weather  üìπ  http://gcn.eu/LX7hy0\n\nMusic:\nGo - Israel Medina - Julian R.

There are geometries to consider to ensure that the handling is spot on as Simon is going for a full custom frame. \n\nThere is also the selection of which tubeset. Simon is buidling his frame from the renowned Italian tubing manufacturer Columbus, who have had their tubing ridden to glory by cycling greats such as Eddy Merckx, Greg LeMond, Fausto Coppi and many more. It is possible to simply select a full model of tubeset, but here is the fun in that? There's hundreds of different possibilities and it is also possible to combine different types of tubing together.

What does he find on his journey?\n\nSimon takes a look at the eyewear from Koo, the sister company of helmet brand Kask. Featuring Carl Zeiss lenses and fully compatible with the Kask helmet range.\n\nSpeedX present the prototype of the Unicorn, featuring their own brand powermeter too. Worth keeping an eye on this as the price for the complete bike, with Shimano Ultegra Di2 and powermeter is just $3400!\n\nEbikes are here to stay, Coast cycles have got a 1000w motor on a bike, however, it's certainly not road legal.\n\nCable specialist Jagwire have got Simon excited, they've managed to lose 50% of the weight on their standard outer gear cables, by replacing the steel outer with a braided version into the polymer liner. Very cool, very light.  Their new inner cables are polished too, so they don't need any coating!\n\nSantini show off the new 2017 Maglia Rosa featuring a gold trim on the pockets to mark the 100th edition of the Giro d'Italia.\n\nDiavelo have a new electric road bike, the Virtuale. It has a 250w motor and will last about 1.75hrs on full power. They've also collaborated with Pininfarina to launch the E-Voluzione which is a very cool looking bike too.\n\nErgon teased Simon with some new insoles designed to give more performance, more control and more power. A great bit of kit to slip inside your existing shoes.\n\nProfile Design have a new TT setup, the Areia Ultimate Cockpit. It's not a one piece system, so that means they can still be adjusted!

As well as there hollow titanium 3d printed pulley wheels!\n\nDT Swiss introduce some new models of wheels including the ERC 1100 DICUT DB47's which are designed with endurance cycling in mind and have a 19mm internal rim width and feature an aero-hub too! Also from DT Swiss are the PR1400 DICUT OXIC which is an aluminum wheel featuring a hardwearing braking surface, and just 1400g a pair.\n\nTRP have recently won an award for the TT specific hydraulic disc brakes and Simon takes a close look at these show-stoppers!\n\nTopeak have a new pump, the Twin Turbo.

You need to know where you are going and see any obstacles in-front. The faster you go, the further ahead you will need to look. \n- Hold the drops. By holding the drops of the handlebars it means that you are more stable and your hands are less likely to come off of the bars should you hit a pothole or debris. Your brake levers are also able to be pulled easier. You will also likely have a lower centre of gravity, enabling you to sweep around corners better.\n- Braking. You need to be able to slow down quickly and safely. Your front brake is most efficient when descending, but you will need to also use your back brake to prevent any mishaps. Oh, and don't steer sharply and brake together, thats bad news. \n\nWatch more on GCN...\nPasso Campolongo Epic Descent üìπ  http://gcn.eu/2dc4D9O\nHow To Hold Your Handlebars Like A Pro  üìπ   http://gcn.eu/60\n\nMusic:\nHot Desert - Marc Adamo, Tico Zamora\n\nFilmed on location in Mallorca\n\nPhotos: ¬© Bettiniphoto / http://www.bettiniphoto.net/ & ¬©Tim De Waele / http://www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D‚ÄôHuez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav√©, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
